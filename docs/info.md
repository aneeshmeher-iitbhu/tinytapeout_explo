## How it works
  The output of the Traffic light simulator we designed is attached for your reference. In the       simulation, C is the sensor signal from Farm side when which is triggered when any vehicle is      present at that side.
  
  Also below are the representation used for different colors of traffic light:
  001 -> GREEN
  010 -> YELLOW
  100 -> RED

## How to test
 it can be tested by using a verilog test bench
